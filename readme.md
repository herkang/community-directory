# Minnesota Community Resource Directory:

Welcome to the Minnesota Community Resource Directory is a platform for users to be able to find local facilities that will allow them to search for their every care needs. A registered user can save and remove resources for their reference. 
# Background:

My name is Kang and Iâ€™m a first generation graduate student from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities this Spring 2020. I earned my degree in Mass Communication and Learning Technologies. As an immigrant from a refugee camp, I was motivated by my personal challenges navigating the healthcare and community system in the United States. I wanted to design and develop a platform for users to be able to find local facilities in the Minnesota area. I hope this platform will give others like myself a chance to find resources that will fit their culturally diverse perspectives and give them comfort knowing they are in familiar hands.
